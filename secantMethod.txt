Secant methods are a class of iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations. They are similar to the Newton-Raphson method, but instead of using the derivative of the function at the current iterate, they use a finite difference approximation of the derivative, which is calculated using the values of the function at two points. Because the derivative does not need to be explicitly calculated, secant methods can be used to solve equations where the derivative is difficult or impossible to obtain. Secant methods can be faster than bisection method but slower than the Newton-Raphson method.
