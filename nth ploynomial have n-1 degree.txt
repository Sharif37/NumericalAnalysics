A polynomial has a degree number.

For example a cubic has degree 3

A quadratic has degree 2 and a quartic and degree 4

The highest power of x is the degree number of a polynomial.

When we differentiate, the highest power of x decreases by 1

When we find turning points, we set this differential equation to 0

By the fundamental theorem of algebra, there must at least (n-1) solutions to this differential equation and â€™nâ€™ solutions to the original question
